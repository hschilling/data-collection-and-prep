New scanning electron images, spectrophotometric measurements and physical modelling are used to unveil the mechanism of this colouration switch. The visible dry-state greenish colouration originates from a widely open porous layer located 3 μm below the cuticle surface. The structure of this layer is three-dimensional, with a network of filamentary strings, arranged in layers parallel to the cuticle surface and stiffening an array of strong cylindrical pillars oriented normal to the surface. Unexpectedly, diffraction plays a significant role in the broadband colouration of the cuticle in the dry state. The backscattering caused by this layer disappears when water infiltrates the structure and weakens the refractive index differences.",,"Journal of Insect Physiology,New Journal of Physics,Applied Physics Letters,Nature",https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/10/3/033014,"""Sense, send, or process information"",Change size or color","Sense signals/environmental cues,Modify color","Sense atmospheric conditions,Change structural color","Modify light/color,Sensing atmospheric conditions",

407,10.2307/1542821,Structural Strengthening of Urchin Skeletons by Collagenous Sutural Ligaments,"Sea urchin skeletons are strengthened by flexible collagenous ligaments that bind together rigid calcite plates at sutures. Whole skeletons without ligaments (removed by bleaching) broke at lower apically applied forces than did intact, fresh skeletons. In addition, in three-point bending tests on excised plate combinations, sutural ligaments strengthened sutures but not plates. The degree of sutural strengthening by ligaments depended on sutural position; in tensile tests, ambital and adapical sutures were strengthened more than adoral sutures. Adapical sutures, which grow fastest, were also the loosest, suggesting that strengthening by ligaments is associated with growth. In fed, growing urchins, sutures overall were looser than in unfed urchins. Looseness was demonstrated visually and by vibration analysis: bleached skeletons of unfed urchins rang at characteristic frequencies, indicating that sound traveled across tightly fitting sutures; skeletons of fed urchins damped vibrations, indicating loss of vibrational energy across looser sutures. Furthermore, bleached skeletons of fed urchins broke at lower apically applied forces than bleached skeletons of unfed urchins, indicating that the sutures of fed urchins had been held together relatively loosely by sutural ligaments. Thus, the apparently rigid dome-like skeleton of urchins sometimes transforms into a flexible, jointed membrane as sutures loosen and become flexible during growth.",,"Comparative Biomechanics: Life's Physical World,Biological Bulletin,Zoomorphology",https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.2307/1542821,"Maintain structural integrity,Protect from harm,Attach,Physically assemble/disassemble","Manage structural forces,Prevent structural failure,Protect from living threats,Attach permanently,Physically assemble structure,Optimize shape/materials","Manage stress/strain,Manage impact,Prevent deformation,Prevent fatigue,Protect from animals,Prevent fracture/rupture","Manage compression,Manage impact,Prevent deformation,Prevent fatigue,Protect from animals",

429,10.1016/j.tibtech.2009.11.005,Forisomes: calcium-powered protein complexes with potential as ‘smart’ biomaterials," Sieve tubes in legumes contain forisomes, which are spindle-like bodies that are composed of ATP-independent, mechanically active proteins. Upon injury, forisomes occlude sieve tubes by dispersion and thus, help to prevent loss of nutrient-rich transport sap. Forisome enlargement by dispersion is brought about by Ca 2+-induced conformational changes that confer radial expansion and longitudinal contraction. Forisomes recontract upon Ca 2+ removal. In vitro, forisomes reversibly disperse and contract in the presence or absence of Ca 2+, respectively, and at distinct pHs. Recently, forisomes have received renewed attention because of their unique capacity to convert chemical into mechanical energy independent of high-energy organic compounds. Forisome-based ‘smart’ materials can be used to produce self-powered monitoring and diagnostic systems. Here, we focus on physiological, chemical and physical aspects of forisomes and discuss their potential as biomimetic devices.",,"Trends in Biotechnology,PNAS,Journal of Experimental Botany",https://www.cell.com/trends/biotechnology/fulltext/S0167-7799(09)00218-2?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0167779909002182%3Fshowall%3Dtrue,"Maintain structural integrity,Protect from harm,Chemically modify or Change energy state","Manage structural forces,Protect from non-living threats,Change energy state,Protect from living threats","Protect from loss of liquids,Modify/convert mechanical energy,Protect from animals,Prevent deformation,Modify/convert chemical energy","Manage shear,Protect from loss of liquids,Transform mechanical energy",

440,10.1016/j.cub.2012.04.051,Intraspecific Directed Deterrence by the Mustard Oil Bomb in a Desert Plant,"Plant secondary metabolites (SMs) acting as defensive chemicals in reproductive organs such as fruit tissues play roles in both mutualistic and antagonistic interactions between plants and seed dispersers/predators [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The directed-deterrence hypothesis states that SMs in ripe fruits deter seed predators but have little or no effect on seed dispersers [6]. Indeed, studies have demonstrated that birds are able to cope with fruit SMs whereas rodents are deterred by them [1, 7]. However, this mechanism was only demonstrated at the class level, i.e., between birds and mammals, based on differences in the vanilloid receptors [7]. Here we present experimental and behavioral data demonstrating the use of the broad-range, class-independent “mustard oil bomb” mechanism in Ochradenus baccatus fruits to force a behavioral change at an ecological timescale, converting rodents from seed predators to seed dispersers. This is achieved by a unique compartmentalization of the mustard oil bomb, causing activation of the system only upon seed and pulp coconsumption, encouraging seed dispersal via seed spitting by rodents. Our findings demonstrate the power of SMs to shift the animal-plant relationship from predation to mutualism and provide support for the directed-deterrence hypothesis at the intraspecific level, in addition to the interspecific level.",,Current Biology,https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(12)00471-X?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS096098221200471X%3Fshowall%3Dtrue,"Process resources,Protect from harm,Maintain ecological community,Chemically modify or Change energy state,""Sense, send, or process information""","Distribute resources,Protect from living threats,Individual benefit,Group benefit,Chemically assemble,Send signals,Process signals,Absorb and/or filter resources,Expel resources","Distribute solids,Protect from animals,Regulate reproduction or growth,Cooperate within/between species,Chemically assemble organic compounds,Send chemical signals,Respond to signals,Sense chemicals,Absorb and/or filter solids,Expel solids",Distribute solids,

480,10.1146/annurev.biochem.68.1.425,Cellular and Molecular Biology of the Aquaporin Water Channels,"The high water permeability characteristic of mammalian red cell membranes is now known to be caused by the protein AQP1. This channel freely permits movement of water across the cell membrane, but it is not permeated by other small, uncharged molecules or charged solutes. AQP1 is a tetramer with each subunit containing an aqueous pore likened to an hourglass formed by obversely arranged tandem repeats. Cryoelectron microscopy of reconstituted AQP1 membrane crystals has revealed the three-dimensional structure at 3–6 Å. AQP1 is distributed in apical and basolateral membranes of renal proximal tubules and descending thin limbs as well as capillary endothelia. Ten mammalian aquaporins have been identified in water-permeable tissues and fall into two groupings. Orthodox aquaporins are water-selective and include AQP2, a vasopressin-regulated water channel in renal collecting duct, in addition to AQP0, AQP4, and AQP5. Multifunctional aquaglyceroporins AQP3, AQP7, and AQP9 are permeated by water, glycerol, and some other solutes. Aquaporins are being defined in numerous other species including amphibia, insects, plants, and microbials. Members of the aquaporin family are implicated in numerous physiological processes as well as the pathophysiology of a wide range of clinical disorders.",,"Annual Review of Biochemistry,Science,Molecular Membrane Biology,Quarterly Review of Biophysics",https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.biochem.68.1.425,"Process resources,""Sense, send, or process information"",Move","Distribute resources,Absorb and/or filter resources,Sense signals/environmental cues,Passive movement","Distribute liquids,Absorb and/or filter liquids,Sense electricity/magnetism,Sense chemicals,Passively move through/on solids","Distribute liquids,""Capture, absorb, or filter chemical entities"",""Capture, absorb, or filter liquids""",

We have studied the cinmutant of Antirrhinum, which has crinkly rather than flat leaves. Leaves of cin display excess growth in marginal regions, resulting in a gradual introduction of negative curvature during development. This reflects a change in the shape and the progression of a cell-cycle arrest front moving from the leaf tip toward the base. CIN encodes a TCP protein and is expressed downstream of the arrest front. We propose that CIN promotes zero curvature (flatness) by making cells more sensitive to an arrest signal, particularly in marginal regions.",,Science,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/299/5611/1404,"Change size or color,Physically assemble/disassemble","Change size/shape,Physically assemble structure",Optimize shape/materials,"Modify size/shape/mass/volume,Regulate reproduction or growth,""Capture, absorb, or filter energy""",

578,10.1098/rspb.2012.1297,Underwater locomotion in a terrestrial beetle: combination of surface de-wetting and capillary forces,"For the first time, we report the remarkable ability of the terrestrial leaf beetle Gastrophysa viridula to walk on solid substrates under water. These beetles have adhesive setae on their feet that produce a secretory fluid having a crucial role in adhesion on land. In air, adhesion is produced by capillary forces between the fluid-covered setae and the substrate. In general, capillary forces do not contribute to adhesion under water. However, our observations showed that these beetles may use air bubbles trapped between their adhesive setae to walk on flooded, inclined substrata or even under water. Beetle adhesion to hydrophilic surfaces under water was lower than that in air, whereas adhesion to hydrophobic surfaces under water was comparable to that in air. Oil-covered hairy pads had a pinning effect, retaining the air bubbles on their feet. Bubbles in contact with the hydrophobic substrate de-wetted the substrate and produced capillary adhesion. Additional capillary forces are generated by the pad's liquid bridges between the foot and the substrate. Inspired by this idea, we designed an artificial silicone polymer structure with underwater adhesive properties.",,Proceedings of the Royal Society B,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2012.1297,"Attach,Move","Attach temporarily,Active movement","Actively move through/on solids,Actively move through/on liquids","Attach temporarily,Move in/on liquids",

582,10.1098/rstb.1998.0313,Vertical jumping in Galago senegalensis: the quest for an obligate mechanical power amplifier,"Bushbabies (Galago senegalensis) are renowned for their phenomenal jumping capacity. It was postulated that mechanical power amplification must be involved. Dynamic analysis of the vertical jumps performed by two bushbabies confirms the need for a power amplifier. Inverse dynamics coupled to a geometric musculo–skeletal model were used to elucidate the precise nature of the mechanism powering maximal vertical jumps. Most of the power required for jumping is delivered by the vastus muscle–tendon systems (knee extensor). Comparison with the external joint–powers revealed, however, an important power transport from this extensor (about 65%) to the ankle and the midfoot via the bi–articular calf muscles. Peak power output likely implies elastic recoil of the complex aponeurotic system of the vastus muscle. Patterns of changes in length and tension of the muscle–tendon complex during different phases of the jump were found which provide strong evidence for substantial power amplification (times 15). It is argued here that the multiple internal connective tissue sheets and attachment structures of the well–developed bundles of the vastus muscle become increasingly stretched during preparatory crouching and throughout the extension phase, except for the last 13 ms of the push–off (i.e. when power requirements peak). Then, tension in the knee extensors abruptly falls from its maximum, allowing the necessary fast recoil of the tensed tendon structures to occur.",,"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B,Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Molecular & Integrative Physiology,Weird Nature: An Astonishing Exploration of Nature's Strangest Behavior",https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.1998.0313,"Process resources,Move,Physically assemble/disassemble","Distribute resources,Store resources,Active movement,Physically assemble structure,Optimize shape/materials,Capture resources","Distribute energy,Store energy,Actively move through/on solids,Actively move through gases,Capture energy","Distribute energy,Store energy,""Capture, absorb, or filter energy""",

From a functional perspective, the weight (mass) of an animal relative to its lift-generating surfaces is a key determinant of the metabolic cost of flight. The evolution of birds has been characterized by many weight-saving adaptations that are reflected in bone shape, many of which strengthen and stiffen the skeleton. Although largely unstudied in birds, the material properties of bone tissue can also contribute to bone strength and stiffness. In this study, I calculated the density of the cranium, humerus and femur in passerine birds, rodents and bats by measuring bone mass and volume using helium displacement. I found that, on average, these bones are densest in birds, followed closely by bats. As bone density increases, so do bone stiffness and strength. Both of these optimization criteria are used in the design of strong and stiff, but lightweight, manmade airframes. By analogy, increased bone density in birds and bats may reflect adaptations for maximizing bone strength and stiffness while minimizing bone mass and volume. These data suggest that both bone shape and the material properties of bone tissue have played important roles in the evolution of flight. They also reconcile the conundrum of how bird skeletons can appear to be thin and delicate, yet contribute just as much to total body mass as do the skeletons of terrestrial mammals.",,Proceedings of the Royal Society B,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2010.0117,"Move,Physically assemble/disassemble,Maintain structural integrity,Change size or color","Optimize shape/materials,Physically assemble structure,Active movement,Passive movement,Prevent structural failure,Manage structural forces,Change size/shape","Actively move through gases,Passively move through gases,Prevent deformation,Prevent fracture/rupture,Manage stress/strain","Modify material characteristics,Move in/through gases,Optimize shape/materials,Physically assemble structure",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100322112103.htm

726,10.1007/PL00008153,Simulating ozone detoxification in the leaf apoplast through the direct reaction with ascorbate,"This paper presents a mathematical model which enables the semi-quantification of ozone (O3) detoxification, based upon the direct reaction of the pollutant with ascorbate (ASC) located in the aqueous matrix associated with the cell wall (i.e. the apoplast). The model describes the uptake of ozone into the leaf and its direct reaction with ASC, taking into consideration the regeneration of dehydroascorbic acid in the cytosol, the rate of replenishment of cell wall ASC and the distribution of ASC between sub-cellular compartments based upon the permeability of biomembranes to the neutral species, ascorbic acid and the pH of various sub-cellular compartments. The importance of various physico-chemical characteristics (e.g. stomatal conductance, mesophyll cell wall thickness and tortuosity, chloroplast volume, apoplast pH, ASC:O3 reaction stoichiometry) in mediating the flux of ozone to the plasmalemma is analysed. Model simulations, supported by experimental observations, suggest that the ASC concentration in the leaf apoplast is high enough to scavenge a significant proportion of the O3 taken up into the leaf interior, under environmentally relevant conditions. However, there is considerable variation between taxa in the potential degree of protection afforded by apoplastic ASC, emphasizing the need for an improved understanding of the reaction chemistry of O3 in the cell wall.",,"Planta,Environmental Pollution and Plant Responses",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10750904/,"Process resources,Protect from harm","Expel resources,Protect from non-living threats,Capture resources,Absorb and/or filter resources,Store resources,Detox/purify","Protect from gases,Protect from radiation,Capture gases,Absorb and/or filter gases,Store gases","Expel gases,""Capture, absorb, or filter chemical entities""",

801,10.1672/0277-5212(2006)26[322:HTSSMV]2.0.CO;2,How tussocks structure sedge meadow vegetation,"Carex stricta dominates sedge meadows in southern Wisconsin, USA. In contrast with invasive species that dominate as monotypes, C. stricta supports a diversity of co-occurring species by forming tussocks. Concerns about diversity loss and the potential to restore species-rich tussocks led us to ask how tussocks foster high species richness and affect composition. Our study of 181 tussocks at three sites showed that tussocks structure sedge meadow vegetation by adding both surface area and micro-habitats. Tussocks, which average 15–25 cm tall, increase surface area of an otherwise flat plot by 40%. Species richness was positively correlated with tussock size, but the patterns differed among sites. At a site where water was deep, tussock height was the best predictor of richness; at two other sites, surface area and circumference were the best predictors. Micro-habitats differed in conditions and species composition: tussock tops were high in light, variable in temperature, and high in litter cover. Tussock sides had less litter but more moss; off-tussock areas tended to be aquatic. Of the 56 taxa found, 34 showed significant affinities for one or more micro-habitats. Of these, four species occurred primarily on tops, several extended from tops to lower levels, seven aquatic taxa preferred areas off-tussocks, and one species specialized in tussock sides. Over the 2004 growing season, species richness increased in an additive process, from 35 species in May to 56 in September 2004. Cover of litter and moss increased and bare surface decreased with season, but only seven of the 34 taxa with micro-site preferences expanded their distributions as the September drawdown exposed the off-tussock micro-habitat. We conclude that tussocks enhance species richness in three ways, by increasing surface area, by providing multiple micro-habitats, and by undergoing seasonal changes in composition. Our detailed data on plant-diversity support by large tussocks form a benchmark for tussock meadow conservation, as well as a target for restoration of degraded meadows.",,Wetlands,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1672/0277-5212(2006)26[322:HTSSMV]2.0.CO;2,Maintain ecological community,Group benefit,"Maintain biodiversity,Cooperate within/between species,Manage populations/pests/diseases,Manage environmental disturbances in a community","Cooperate within an ecosystem,Maintain biodiversity,Regulate climate",
